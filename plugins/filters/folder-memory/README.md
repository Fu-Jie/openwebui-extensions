**Folder Memory** is an intelligent context filter plugin for OpenWebUI. It automatically extracts consistent "Project Rules" from ongoing conversations within a folder and injects them back into the folder's system prompt.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Extraction**: Analyzes chat history every N messages to extract project rules.
- **Non-destructive Injection**: Updates only the specific "Project Rules" block in the system prompt, preserving other instructions.
- **Async Processing**: Runs in the background without blocking the user's chat experience.
- **ORM Integration**: Directly updates folder data using OpenWebUI's internal models for reliability.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

- **Conversations must occur inside a folder.** This plugin only triggers when a chat belongs to a folder (i.e., you need to create a folder in OpenWebUI and start a conversation within it).

## 📦 Installation

1. Copy `folder_memory.py` to your OpenWebUI `plugins/filters/` directory (or upload via Admin UI).
2. Enable the filter in your **Settings** -> **Filters**.
3. (Optional) Configure the triggering threshold (default: every 10 messages).

## ⚙️ Configuration (Valves)

| Valve | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PRIORITY` | `20` | Priority level for the filter operations. |
| `MESSAGE_TRIGGER_COUNT` | `10` | The number of messages required to trigger a rule analysis. |
| `MODEL_ID` | `""` | The model used to generate rules. If empty, uses the current chat model. |
| `RULES_BLOCK_TITLE` | `## 📂 Project Rules` | The title displayed above the injected rules block. |
| `SHOW_DEBUG_LOG` | `False` | Show detailed debug logs in the browser console. |
| `UPDATE_ROOT_FOLDER` | `False` | If enabled, finds and updates the root folder rules instead of the current subfolder. |

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Trigger**: When a conversation reaches `MESSAGE_TRIGGER_COUNT` (e.g., 10, 20 messages).
2. **Analysis**: The plugin sends the recent conversation + existing rules to the LLM.
3. **Synthesis**: The LLM merges new insights with old rules, removing obsolete ones.
4. **Update**: The new rule set replaces the `<!-- OWUI_PROJECT_RULES_START -->` block in the folder's system prompt.

## ⚠️ Notes

- This plugin modifies the `system_prompt` of your folders.
- It uses a specific marker `<!-- OWUI_PROJECT_RULES_START -->` to locate its content. Do not manually remove these markers if you want the plugin to continue managing that section.

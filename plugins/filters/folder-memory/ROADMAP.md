# Roadmap

## Future Features

### 🧠 Project Knowledge (Planned)
In future versions, we plan to introduce "Project Knowledge" collection. Unlike "Rules" which are strict instructions, "Knowledge" will capture reusable information, consensus, and context that helps the LLM understand the project better.

- **Knowledge Extraction**: Automatically extract reusable knowledge (terminology, style guides, business logic) from conversations.
- **Long-term Memory**: Use the entire folder's chat history as a corpus for knowledge generation.
- **Context Injection**: Inject summarized knowledge into the system prompt alongside rules.
